## Project Description

This project focuses on the design and implementation of an **Entity-Relationship (ER) model** for *Ortizo*, a virtual and physical music store. The goal is to structure and visualize the store’s database by representing key entities such as **Instruments**, **Inventory**, **Suppliers**, **Receipts**, and more, alongside their relationships. The project also involves the creation of a detailed **report** and a **poster** that showcase the ER model and its applications within the business.

### Objectives

- To design a comprehensive **Entity-Relationship Diagram** for the store, including all core components like instruments, suppliers, inventory, and transactions.
- To develop a **report** outlining the design process, decisions made, and the functionality of the model.
- To create a **poster** summarizing the ER model, highlighting the most important aspects of the store’s data structure.

## Project Components

### 1. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
   - The ERD visually represents all major entities within the *Ortizo* music store.
   - Key entities include:
     - **Instrument**: Represents the products sold in the store, categorized by type and brand.
     - **Supplier**: Stores information about suppliers and their relationships with instruments.
     - **Inventory**: Manages stock levels for instruments and accessories.
     - **Receipt**: Tracks both sales and purchase transactions, distinguishing between the two.
     - **Accessory**: Represents additional items like guitar picks and drumsticks, also categorized by type and brand.
   - Relationships between entities have been defined to represent the real-world processes of the store, such as restocking inventory from suppliers and processing customer sales.

### 2. **Report**:
   - The report elaborates on the design of the ER model, explaining the choices made for entity attributes and relationships.
   - The structure of the report includes:
     - Introduction to the *Ortizo* music store.
     - Step-by-step design of the ER diagram.
     - Detailed explanation of each entity and its attributes.
     - Discussion on how the model can be used to manage inventory, track sales, and handle supplier relationships.

### 3. **Poster**:
   - A visual summary of the ER model.
   - The poster presents the ER diagram, accompanied by brief descriptions of key entities and their relationships.
   - It highlights the most important features of the model, such as **inventory management** and **supplier interactions**.

## Features of the ER Model

- **Comprehensive Inventory Management**: 
   The model allows *Ortizo* to efficiently track instruments, accessories, and stock levels, ensuring up-to-date inventory information.
   
- **Transaction Tracking**: 
   By managing sales and purchase receipts, the model helps store all transaction history in a structured way.

- **Supplier Relationships**: 
   The model includes supplier information to optimize the restocking process, ensuring that instruments and accessories are always available.

- **Scalability**: 
   The design can be expanded to include additional features such as customer data, shopping cart functionality, and discount management in future versions.

## Future Work

- **Integration with a Database Management System (DBMS)**:  
   The next step is to implement this ER model into a relational DBMS like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
   
- **Extension for Customer Management**:  
   Future versions of the model may include customer data, shopping carts, and physical store transactions to fully capture all aspects of the *Ortizo* business.


## Execution Instructions
